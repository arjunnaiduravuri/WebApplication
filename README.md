Project Explanation

1) Frontend Interface: This is what users interact with. It includes:

      Registration Form: Allows users to create a new account by providing details like username, email, password, etc.
      
      Login Form: Enables existing users to log in using their credentials.
      
      UI/UX Elements: Such as buttons, input fields, and error messages to facilitate user interaction.
      
2) Backend Server: Responsible for handling requests from the frontend and interacting with the database. It consists of:

      API Endpoints: URLs that the frontend communicates with to perform actions like user registration, login, logout, etc.
      
      Authentication Middleware: Verifies user credentials during login and generates authentication tokens for subsequent requests.
      
      Database Interaction Layer: Code to interact with the database for storing and retrieving user information securely.
      
3) Database: Stores user data securely. Commonly used databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.

4) Authentication Mechanism:

      Registration: When a user signs up, their credentials are validated, and if successful, stored securely in the database.
      
      Login: Users provide their credentials, which are verified against the records in the database. Upon successful authentication, a session token or JWT (JSON Web Token) is issued to maintain their logged-in state.
